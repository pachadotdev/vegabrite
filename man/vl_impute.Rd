  spec,

\arguments{
\item{spec}{An input vega-lite spec}

\item{.object}{Directly input an object, rather than creating one via the other arguments. Should not be used in conjunction with the other arguments other than 'spec'. Objects can be of type: ImputeTransform}

\item{impute}{The data field for which the missing values should be imputed.}

\item{key}{A key field that uniquely identifies data objects within a group. Missing
key values (those occurring in the data but not in the current group) will be
imputed.}

\item{frame}{A frame specification as a two-element array used to control the window over
which the specified method is applied. The array entries should either be a
number indicating the offset from the current data object, or null to indicate
unbounded rows preceding or following the current data object. For example, the
value \verb{[-5, 5]} indicates that the window should include five objects preceding
and five objects following the current object.

\strong{Default value:}: \verb{[null, null]} indicating that the window includes all
objects.}

\item{groupby}{An optional array of fields by which to group the values. Imputation will then
be performed on a per-group basis.}

\item{keyvals}{Defines the key values that should be considered for imputation.
An array of key values or an object defining a \href{https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/impute.html#sequence-def}{number sequence}.

If provided, this will be used in addition to the key values observed within the
input data. If not provided, the values will be derived from all unique values
of the \code{key} field. For \code{impute} in \code{encoding}, the key field is the x-field if
the y-field is imputed, or vice versa.

If there is no impute grouping, this property \emph{must} be specified.}

\item{method}{The imputation method to use for the field value of imputed data objects. One of
\code{"value"}, \code{"mean"}, \code{"median"}, \code{"max"} or \code{"min"}.

\strong{Default value:} \code{"value"}}

\item{value}{The field value to use when the imputation \code{method} is \code{"value"}.}
