vl_config_errorband(
  spec,
  band = NULL,
  borders = NULL,
  extent = NULL,
  interpolate = NULL,
  tension = NULL,
  .object = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spec}{An input vega-lite spec}

\item{band}{boolean

Or: MarkConfig}

\item{borders}{boolean

Or: MarkConfig}

\item{extent}{The extent of the band. Available options include:
\itemize{
\item \code{"ci"}: Extend the band to the confidence interval of the mean.
\item \code{"stderr"}: The size of band are set to the value of standard error, extending
from the mean.
\item \code{"stdev"}: The size of band are set to the value of standard deviation,
extending from the mean.
\item \code{"iqr"}: Extend the band to the q1 and q3.
}

\strong{Default value:} \code{"stderr"}.}

\item{interpolate}{The line interpolation method for the error band. One of the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{"linear"}: piecewise linear segments, as in a polyline.
\item \code{"linear-closed"}: close the linear segments to form a polygon.
\item \code{"step"}: a piecewise constant function (a step function) consisting of
alternating horizontal and vertical lines. The y-value changes at the midpoint
of each pair of adjacent x-values.
\item \code{"step-before"}: a piecewise constant function (a step function) consisting
of alternating horizontal and vertical lines. The y-value changes before the
x-value.
\item \code{"step-after"}: a piecewise constant function (a step function) consisting
of alternating horizontal and vertical lines. The y-value changes after the
x-value.
\item \code{"basis"}: a B-spline, with control point duplication on the ends.
\item \code{"basis-open"}: an open B-spline; may not intersect the start or end.
\item \code{"basis-closed"}: a closed B-spline, as in a loop.
\item \code{"cardinal"}: a Cardinal spline, with control point duplication on the ends.
\item \code{"cardinal-open"}: an open Cardinal spline; may not intersect the start or
end, but will intersect other control points.
\item \code{"cardinal-closed"}: a closed Cardinal spline, as in a loop.
\item \code{"bundle"}: equivalent to basis, except the tension parameter is used to
straighten the spline.
\item \code{"monotone"}: cubic interpolation that preserves monotonicity in y.
}}

\item{tension}{The tension parameter for the interpolation type of the error band.}

\item{.object}{Directly input an object, rather than creating one via the other arguments. Should not be used in conjunction with the other arguments other than 'spec'. Objects can be of type: ErrorBandConfig}
}
\value{
A modified Vega-Lite Spec
}
\description{
Add errorband config (ErrorBandConfig) to a vega-lite spec.
