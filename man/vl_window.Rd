\usage{
vl_window(
  spec,
  .object = NULL,
  window = NULL,
  frame = NULL,
  groupby = NULL,
  ignorePeers = NULL,
  sort = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spec}{An input vega-lite spec}

\item{.object}{Directly input an object, rather than creating one via the other arguments. Should not be used in conjunction with the other arguments other than 'spec'. Objects can be of type: WindowTransform}

\item{window}{The definition of the fields in the window, and what calculations to use.}

\item{frame}{A frame specification as a two-element array indicating how the sliding
window should proceed. The array entries should either be a number indicating
the offset from the current data object, or null to indicate unbounded
rows preceding or following the current data object. The default value
is \verb{[null, 0]}, indicating that the sliding window includes the current
object and all preceding objects. The value \verb{[-5, 5]} indicates that the
window should include five objects preceding and five objects following
the current object. Finally, \verb{[null, null]} indicates that the window frame
should always include all data objects. If you this frame and want to assign
the same value to add objects, you can use the simpler \href{https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/joinaggregate.html}{join aggregate transform}. The
only operators affected are the aggregation operations and the \code{first_value},
\code{last_value}, and \code{nth_value} window operations. The other window operations are
not affected by this.

\strong{Default value:}: \verb{[null, 0]} (includes the current object and all preceding
objects)}

\item{groupby}{The data fields for partitioning the data objects into separate windows. If
unspecified, all data points will be in a single window.}

\item{ignorePeers}{Indicates if the sliding window frame should ignore peer values (data that are
considered identical by the sort criteria). The default is false, causing the
window frame to expand to include all peer values. If set to true, the window
frame will be defined by offset values only. This setting only affects those
operations that depend on the window frame, namely aggregation operations and
the first_value, last_value, and nth_value window operations.

\strong{Default value:} \code{false}}

\item{sort}{A sort field definition for sorting data objects within a window. If two data
objects are considered equal by the comparator, they are considered "peer"
values of equal rank. If sort is not specified, the order is undefined: data
objects are processed in the order they are observed and none are considered
peers (the ignorePeers parameter is ignored and treated as if set to \code{true}).}
